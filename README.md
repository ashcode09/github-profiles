## Local Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashleigh090990/github-profiles

$ cd github-profiles

$ npm install

$ bower install
```

Currently not working when you run it locally (using webdriver-manager and http-server - am working on fixing that) - but works perfectly when you:

```
$ open index.html
```
